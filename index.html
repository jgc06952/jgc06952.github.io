		<p><b>Pasta</b> is my <em>favorite food</em>. Growing up, it was pretty much what my parents cooked for my family every single night, and I never got sick of it. With all the different shapes, kinds of sauces and cheese, my family craved pasta every night.<br> Because I do not live at home with my family anymore, Iâ€™ve had to start making pasta on my own, and it is really hard to make it as good as my parents do. </p>
		<p>There is a lot of practice and skill that goes into making a great pasta dish, but I think that I have mastered roasted red pepper pasta. This pasta is pretty easy to make, and it only requires a couple fresh ingredients. My mom used to follow a recipe for this, but we made it together so much that I have pretty much memorized the measurements (or I do whatever feels right!). You need any shape of pasta, a jar of roasted red peppers, heavy cream, basil, garlic, salt, pepper, and <del><small>a little</small></del> <ins><big>LOTS</big></ins> of parmesan cheese. </p>
		<p> I have made this dish so many times for me and my friends at college, and it is always a hit. Cooking for people is one of my favorite things to do, because it is so fun and it brings people together! </p>
